        <div class="bio">
            <p>I go by several identities on Sky, but this is my primary identity. <br>
            <br> Light started out as a naive child of light, exploring the world to their whims and constantly wondering, searching, wandering. It wasn't until the Season of Shattering when they found their surprising
                affinity for <u>corrupted plants of darkness</u>.

    <div class="body">
        <p><i>When they found the corrupted plant mask, they allowed the darkness overgrowth to take over their body. They grew closer to the plants of darkness, and began to embrace the solitude that accompanies a hermetic lifestyle.<br>
            <br> Light had trekked the realms alone for the most part. Sometimes they came across other people, but ultimately regressed back into their comfortable bubble. Their favorite realm is the Hidden Forest of course since it's 
            sprawling with darkness plants... sometimes Light will purposefully stand out in the rain, exposing themselves to the elements even if it ends up hurting them.
