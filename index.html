        <p>Hey, are you new here? Already familiar with Sky? That's no problem! My name is Light, and I'll be the tour guide responsible for leading us down memory lane. Join me in our home space as I chronicle my adventures in Sky, telling you about the people I met and the feelings that Sky evoked out of me! Hopefully I can connect with you this way.</p>
