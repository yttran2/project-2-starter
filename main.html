        <h2>If you've stumbled across this home space, you must be part of the Sky community in some way. Do you know what it means to be a “child of light”? We have all descended from the clouds with a purpose in mind; what that purpose would be wasn't immediately clear to us. To uncover meaning from our existence, we explore the world which we descended upon, imprinting our steps onto grains of sand and earthly soil. <br>
        <br>When you first fell down, you saw a beacon of light awaiting you, situated up high in the sky did you not? You let out honks and cries to guide you towards your destination, wondering what sorts of places you'll come across along the way. But no matter how far you strayed, how deep you've trekked into the rainy woods and grim wastelands...you always had <b>home</b> to come back to.</h2>

            <p>I am forever indebted to the sanctuary this world provided me, and so I will provide the same for you. Here there is no need to spend hours tirelessly grinding for limited time cosmetics. There are no anonymous threats here either. There is only you and me, two Sky children yearning for carefree days, bonding over a shared experience. I hope this is sufficient enough for you to call this a third home.</p>

            <p><span>August 22nd, 2020</span> — I first downloaded Sky: Children of the Light. My best friend recommended this game to me during a period of time when we couldn't see each other in person, so I tried it out. I learned the ropes of the game and began taking my first steps into the world of Sky as a clueless "moth", though at the time I had no idea that was what new players were called.<br>
            <br>I can still recall the stunning visuals of Isle of Dawn when I first saw them, and the sheer awe that stuck with me as an impressionable player. But I also remember the distinct feeling of being "alone" in this seemingly deserted world. I think I saw an anonymous player walking past me, but I had to doubt if they were even real or if it was a preexisting NPC. 
            Either way, there's a melancholic yet comforting sentiment to be found in solitude.

            <p>My adventure began with a friend to guide me, but for the majority of the time, I was alone. I explored each realm of Sky at my own leisure, soaking in the dreamlike atmosphere enveloping me everywhere I looked. I marveled at verdant fields, frolicked around a dreary and rainy forest, eagerly raced down a snowy mountain into a grand stadium, then was whisked down into the desolate wastelands.<br>
            <br> The Golden Wasteland was a complete contrast to the realms before it. The dangerous Dark Dragons (Krill) and other deadly inhabitants of that area unveiled to me a new aspect of this "picturesque" dreamland; do not allow yourself to be complacent. Now there exists stakes at hand, and although they scared me, I discovered a new thrill that livened this universe up. To know that <b>darkness</b> too
             must exist in this world... <i>that inevitability fascinated me.</i>
