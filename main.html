        <h2>If you've stumbled across this home space, you must be part of the Sky community in some way. Do you know what it means to be a “child of light”? We have all descended from the clouds with a purpose in mind; what that purpose would be wasn't immediately clear to us. To uncover meaning from our existence, we explore the world which we descended upon, imprinting our steps onto grains of sand and earthly soil. <br>
        <br>When you first fell down, you saw a beacon of light awaiting you, situated up high in the sky did you not? You let out honks and cries to guide you towards your destination, wondering what sorts of places you'll come across along the way. But no matter how far you strayed, how deep you've trekked into the rainy woods and grim wastelands...you always had <b>home</b> to come back to.</h2>

            <p>I am forever indebted to the sanctuary this world provided me, and so I will provide the same for you. Here there is no need to spend hours tirelessly grinding for limited time cosmetics. There are no anonymous threats here either. There is only you and me, two Sky children yearning for carefree days, bonding over a shared experience. I hope this is sufficient enough for you to call this a third home.</p>
